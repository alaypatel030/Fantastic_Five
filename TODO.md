#Tentative To-Do List:

- [ ] Cells in Teacher GUIs don't need to be editable
 
- [ ] Change Student Add/Drop Course button to Register/Drop Course
 
- [ ] Teacher View Schedule doesn't need "Teacher" column

- [ ] Implement help button? Use this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLvZhenUbgM

- [ ] MAKE SURE THAT TABLES WITH SORTING ARE GETTING ROW VALUES CORRECTLY. Use this:
 
table.getModel().getValueAt(table.convertRowIndexToModel(table.getSelectedRow()), <Column Needed Here>)

Only necessary on tables with SORTING.
